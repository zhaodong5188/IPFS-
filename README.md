IPFs, fully known as interplanetary file system, is a distributed storage and transmission protocol with content addressable, versioned and point-to-point hypermedia.
IPFs combines many technologies (P2P network technology, BitTorrent transmission technology, GIT version control, data transmission protocol of self certified file system, etc.), and improves and innovates on these technologies, integrating a decentralized, IPFs network.
IPFs aims to complement or even replace the hypertext media transfer protocol (HTTP) used in the past 20 years.
Moreover, in August 2017, a record amount of US $250 million was raised. This time, token sale only sold 10% of the tokens, which means that IPFs has not been officially launched, and the market value has reached US $2.5 billion.

The long-term development of filecoin is mainly determined by whether its bottom layer can continue to promote. At present, the filecoin market is hot, "investment" and "speculation" coexist. Only those who are technology-oriented, have and adhere to the consensus can finally obtain the real value precipitated after the explosion of technology, while speculators will only be a flash in the pan. In this regard, the people who lead the blockchain and IPFs technology to the future, such as IPFs global node participants, are more worthy of respect, and the value they can bring is more far-reaching and more inclusive.
Now, more clear network parameters and industrial ecological pattern of filecoin will appear in front of us. Let's wait and see how the stability of the filecoin network and the pattern of the filecoin industry will be formed!

The distributed storage network of filecoin not only makes up for the lack of security and privacy of centralized storage. It also plays an important role in promoting the development of blockchain industry, and provides a new solution for blockchain data storage. For example, traceability projects can store traceability data into the filecoin network through smart contracts, and public chain projects can also achieve interoperability with filecoin network data in a cross chain way to promote commercial implementation.


On October 4, the block height has reached 116293, and the main network of filecoin will be officially opened when the block height reaches 148888. Now there are 40669 left. According to the current average filecoin, a block is produced every 30 seconds. It is estimated that the main network will be started at about 22:45 p.m. on October 15.
The protocol laboratory team, known as the "king of pigeons of the Millennium", has accurately launched the main network of filecoin to the height of the block. It is a certainty that the main network of filecoin will go online. It is expected that filecoin will finally come.
